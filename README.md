# Week 4 Task – CMOS Circuit Design (sky130-style) 

This task deepens your understanding of how transistor-level circuit properties (device 
physics, sizing, variation) drive the timing behavior that STA analyzes. By working through 
CMOS design and SPICE simulations (as in the sky130 workshop), you will see the “real” 
side of what STA approximates. This strengthens your intuition about slack, delay, noise 
margins, and variation impacts.
